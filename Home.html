                <h1>HISTORY OF SPACE RACE</h1>
                <p>The Space Race was a 20th-century competition between two Cold War rivals, the Soviet Union and the United States, to 
                    achieve superior spaceflight capability. It had its origins in the ballistic missile-based nuclear arms race between 
                    the two nations following World War II. The technological advantage demonstrated by spaceflight achievement was seen 
                    as necessary for national security, and became part of the symbolism and ideology of the time. The Space Race brought
                    pioneering launches of artificial satellites, robotic space probes to the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and human spaceflight
                    in low Earth orbit and ultimately to the Moon. The Cold War was a competition between the United States and the 
                    Soviet Union in every conceivable arena — even space. When the Soviets launched the world's first artificial satellite, 
                    Sputnik I, in October 1957, it set off alarm bells in the Eisenhower administration and created intense fear and 
                    anxiety among the US public that the Soviet Union had surpassed the technological achievements of the United States. 
                    In response to perceptions of Soviet technological success, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  
                    was established on October 1, 1958 as the primary federal agency responsible for aerospace research and the civilian 
                    space program.

                <h1>SPACE RACE AND COLD WAR</h1>
                <p>Following the Second World War in 1946, tensions rose between two of the victors; the Soviet Union (USSR) and the 
                    United States (US) The primary source of conflict arose from the struggle between two political beliefs of communism 
                    (USSR) and capitalism (US). This conflict became known as the Cold War. The term cold in this context meant that 
                    there was no direct fighting between the two sides, but each sponsored and supported many conflicts across the world.
                    The Cold War lasted until 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Space Race played a significant part in the 
                    Cold War as the Americans and Soviets competed to prove their technological and intellectual superiority by becoming 
                    the first nation to put a human into space. From beginning to end, the world's attention was captivated by this 
                    contest for dominance.  
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: -25px;">The Space Race between the United States (US) and the Soviet Union (USSR) was a 
                    remarkable time in history with many far-reaching achievements in science, space exploration, and technology. 
                    This timeline shows the twenty-year competition between the two nations.

                        world attention by broadcasting a pre-recorded Christmas message from US President Dwight D. Eisenhower, becoming 
                        the first broadcast of a human voice from space.  </li>

                        escaped the orbit of the Moon due to the object having too much speed. Luna 1 becomes the first human-made object 
                        to leave the orbit of the Earth and orbit the sun instead. </li>

                    <li><span>19 August 1960</span> &ensp;Aboard the Soviet Union's Sputnik 5, the first animals (two dogs, Belka and 
                        Strelka) and a range of plants are returned alive from space. </li>
                    <li><span>31 January 1961</span> &ensp;Ham, a US chimpanzee, becomes the first hominid (or great ape) in space and

                    <li><span>12 April 1961</span> &ensp;The Soviet Union achieve a clear triumph in the Space Race. Aboard the Vostok 1, 
                        Yuri Gagarin makes a single orbit around the Earth and becomes the first man to reach space. He remained in space 
                        for one hour and forty-eight minutes before landing in Saratov Oblast, west Russia. </li>
                    <li><span>5 May 1961</span> &ensp;The US achieve the first pilot-controlled journey and first American in space with 
                        Alan Shepard aboard the Mercury-Redstone 3 (or Freedom 7) spacecraft. On this flight, Shepard did not orbit Earth. 
                        He flew 116 miles high. The flight lasted about 15 minutes.  </li>
                    <li><span>16 June 1963</span> &ensp;Valentina Tereshkova becomes the first civilian and first woman in space. She 
                        spends almost three days in space, orbiting the Earth 48 times aboard her spacecraft, Vostok 6. </li>
                    <li><span>18 March 1965</span> &ensp;Alexei Leonov leaves his spacecraft, the Voskhod 2, in a specialized spacesuit

                    <li><span>1967</span> &ensp;This year proves the most deadly of the Space Race for both the US and Soviet Union. In 
                        January, American astronauts Ed White, Gus Grissom, and Roger Chaffee die when a fire ignited in their Apollo 1 
                        capsule on the launch pad. Only a few months later the Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov is also killed when the 
                        parachute on his Soyuz 1 capsule fails to open on his reentry into Earth's atmosphere. </li>
                    <li><span>21 December 1968</span> &ensp;US spacecraft Apollo 8 becomes the first human-crewed spacecraft to reach the 
                        Moon, orbit it, and successfully return to Earth.  </li>
                    <li><span>20 July 1969</span> &ensp;Neil Armstrong and later Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin become the first men to walk on the 
                        Moon while their crewmate Michael Collins continues to orbit the Moon aboard the Apollo 11. This secured a victory 
                        for America in the Space Race with a televised landing witnessed around the world by 723 million people. </li>
                    <li><span>11 April 1970</span> &ensp;The US Apollo 13 mission is known as the first explosion onboard a spacecraft 
                        where the crew survived.  </li>
                    <li><span>19 April 1971</span> &ensp;The USSR launches the first space station. Parts of this spacecraft will become 
                        core segments of the International Space Station (ISS) almost thirty years later in November 2000.  </li>
                    <li><span>1 August 1971</span> &ensp;David Scott, commander of the Apollo 15 mission, becomes the first person to 
                        drive on the Moon. He's also remembered for paying tribute to the Soviet Union and US astronauts who died in the 
                        advancement of space exploration. When walking on the Moon, Scott places a plaque with a list of the dead. 
                        Alongside this, he leaves a small aluminium sculpture of an astronaut in a spacesuit, created by Belgian artist 
                        Paul Van Hoeydonck. </li>
                    <li><span>15 July 1975</span> &ensp;With tensions between the US and USSR softening, the first cooperative Apollo-Soyuz mission 
                        is launched. With two separate flights, the Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft dock in space and the two commanders Tom 
                        Stafford and Alexei Leonov exchange the first international handshake. This act can be seen to symbolically end 
                        the Space Race, paving the way for future joint missions, such as the International Space Station and the 
                        Shuttle-Mir programme. </li>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-top: -25px;">With no official measure of success, the winner of the Space Race is a point of controversy. Most historians agree 
                    that the space race ended on 20 July 1969 when Neil Armstrong stepped onto the Moon for the first time. As the climax 
                    of space history and exploration, the lunar landing led to a triumph for the US.While the US set a man on the Moon 
                    first, their success was fed by a series of pioneering achievements by the Soviet Union. The Space Race can be seen 
                    as a climactic comeback for the United States starting in 1968, rather than a decisive victory. Following the Moon 
                    landing, the Soviet Union concentrated their efforts on building a space station. On 7 June 1971, the Soyuz 11 
                    spacecraft successfully docked with the Salyut 1 space laboratory and completed a record 22-day stay, demonstrating 
                    that space exploration would continue. Furthermore, in May 1972, the US and the Soviet Union negotiated an easing of 
                    hostile relations. This "thaw" in the cold war led to cooperation between the two nations on future missions, and the
                    Space Race became a joint venture.

                <h1>EFFECTS OF COLD WAR</h1>
                <p style="margin-bottom: -25px;">The Cold War shook the foundation of the world, as it was the first time that large-scale 
                    nuclear warfare became a truly realistic threat. Spanning approximately 45 years between 1947 and 1991, wherein no 
                    direct battles were fought, the Cold War was a period of intense geopolitical tension between the United States and 
                    the Soviet Union.

                            <p>At the end of World War II, the majority of American leadership was in agreement that the most viable 
                                approach against the political and militaristic expansion of the Soviet Union was to implement a 
                                containment strategy that would help keep the Soviet expansion in check and protect Western democratic 
                                values. In 1947, President Harry Truman made the containment of the Soviet Union a top priority, laying 
                                the groundwork for the Cold War by introducing domestic policies that centered on undermining communism 
                                in the United States. American diplomat, George Kennan, described this strategy as “a political force 
                                committed fanatically to the belief that with the United States, there can be no permanent  
                                agreement between parties that disagree”; concluding that America had only one option to proceed, 
                                “long-term, patient but firm and vigilant containment of Russian expansive tendencies.”

                            <p>
                                The United States began manufacturing armaments at an excessive rate, rationalizing the production of 
                                these arms as necessary to ward off potential conflict. American officials recommended that the United 
                                States develop and deploy atomic weapons in an effort to keep Soviet doctrines and policies from expanding 
                                unchecked throughout Europe and the world, and to highlight to the Soviets that there would be dire 
                                consequences if they continued their expansionist policies. The U.S.'s containment efforts—which focused on 
                                a blend of increased arms production, ramped up militarism and displays of force throughout the world, the 
                                continued promise of mutually assured destruction by nuclear weapons, and the containment of 
                                Soviet-supported, communist political movements outside the Soviet Union—led to the American defense budget 
                                quadrupling. Not only were small arms, aircraft, ships, and land-based military vehicles being produced en 
                                masse, the containment and arms race-related policies employed by the U.S. also jumpstarted a nuclear arms 
                                race, as the Soviet Union and the U.S. tried to outdo one another by creating more powerful and increasingly 
                                sophisticated nuclear weapons. The arms race culminated in an effort to develop nuclear weapons similar to 
                                the atom bombs dropped at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which brought a violent end to World War II. The Soviet 
                                Union recognized the immense military value of having atomic weapons and went on to develop their own atomic 
                                bombs in 1949. To maintain their perceived superiority and suppress Soviet attempts at becoming a global 
                                leader, the United States began production of an even more devastating weapon: the hydrogen bomb.

                            <p>
                                The development of the hydrogen bomb is a widely discussed topic, as there were many conflicting spheres 
                                of influence involved with its production within the political, social, and scientific communities. Some 
                                scientists, like Edward Teller, were proponents of the production of a super-bomb, while others were 
                                extremely opposed to the idea. While anti-communist tensions were at a moderate baseline in the early 
                                years of the Cold War, the period of time encompassing the race to develop a functional hydrogen bomb set 
                                the precedent for the rising tensions of the Cold War as it escalated throughout the 20th century. The 
                                first successful detonation of an American-made hydrogen device occurred on November 1, 1952, in the 
                                Pacific region on the Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands. This test involved the deployment of 
                                10.4-megaton apparatus nicknamed Mike, and the resulting explosion was a visible example of just how 
                                justified the rising level of public fear and anxiety towards hydrogen weapons had been. The blast 
                                decimated nearby islands, leaving behind a crater more than a mile wide and creating a virulent mushroom 
                                cloud that was an approximate 100 miles wide and 25 miles high. Following this test, the Soviet Union 
                                then rushed to develop hydrogen bomb technology. With the implementation of the hydrogen bomb, the Cold 
                                War was in full swing, as the American and Soviet governments—along with their respective citizens—became 
                                entirely fixated on the growing threat of thermonuclear conflict.

                                The Cold War also resulted in a technological competition between the Soviets and the U.S. as the two 
                                nations vied against one another to achieve space supremacy. On October 4, 1957, this space-race began 
                                when a Soviet satellite named Sputnik was launched into orbit using an intercontinental ballistic missile. 
                                The launch of Sputnik represented the ever-growing power of the Soviet Union and highlighted that the U.S. 
                                was starting to fall behind in the technology-driven space race. Additionally, Sputnik showcased the power 
                                of Soviet missiles, which had effectively demonstrated the capability of delivering nuclear payloads into 
                                orbit, and possibly onto American soil. In response, the United States Army launched Explorer I into space 
                                on January 1, 1958. This satellite was designed by scientist Wernher von Braun, a pioneer in modern rocket 
                                science, and it led to the creation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) by President 
                                Dwight Eisenhower. Even with this launch of the American satellite, the Soviets remained in the lead, 
                                managing to launch the first manned space mission in April 1961. Eight years later, Neil Armstrong became 
                                the first man to walk on the surface of the moon, claiming American victory in the space race. The space 
                                race highlights a period of the Cold War where both the Soviet Union and the U.S. aimed to boost the morale 
                                of their citizens by showcasing their technological innovations.

                            <p>
                                Built in 1961, the Berlin Wall was designed by the Communist government of the German Democratic Republic 
                                as a means of curtailing the flow of East German migrants into democratic West Germany. This almost 
                                100-mile long fortified line of watchtowers, concrete barricades, and trenches effectively split Berlin 
                                in two. The Berlin Wall became a potent symbol of the Iron Curtain—the ideological and physical divide 
                                that separated the democratic West from the communist East during the Cold War. Though, as the 1960s came 
                                to a close, communist power began its decline, as during this time the United States began accelerating 
                                towards becoming the world's first completely unparalleled superpower. When President Richard Nixon took 
                                office in 1969, the American approach to international relations began to switch in favor of diplomacy. 
                                For instance, the United States went on to establish diplomatic relations with communist China. The 
                                United States also drafted and signed the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty with the Soviets in 1972 and 
                                1979, a treaty that placed limitations on the manufacture of nuclear weapons by both parties, partially 
                                eliminating the perceived threat of global thermonuclear warfare. While Ronald Reagan battled communism 
                                in Central America and across the world, economic problems rooted in the Cold War caused Soviet influence 
                                to wane in Europe, and by 1989, most communist nations had transitioned to non-communist forms of 
                                government. In November of 1989, the Berlin Wall, a famous symbol of communism throughout the world, was 
                                demolished by Berlin natives who were given permission to cross the border on November 9, 1989. By 
                                October 3, 1990, East and West Germany reunified. In the wake of these events, the Cold War gradually 
                                slowed to a halt, finally ending with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
