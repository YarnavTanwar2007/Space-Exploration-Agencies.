                <h1>ISRO</h1>
                <p>The Indian Space Research Organisation is the national space agency of India, headquartered in Bangalore. It operates 
                    under the Department of Space (DOS) which is directly overseen by the Prime Minister of India, while the Chairman of 
                    ISRO acts as the executive of DOS as well. ISRO is India's primary agency performing tasks related to space-based 
                    applications, space exploration and the development of related technologies. It is one of six government space 
                    agencies in the world which possess full launch capabilities, deploy cryogenic engines, launch extraterrestrial 
                    missions and operate large fleets of artificial satellites. The Indian National Committee for Space Research 
                    (INCOSPAR) was established by Jawaharlal Nehru under the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) in 1962, on the urging of 
                    scientist Vikram Sarabhai, recognising the need in space research. INCOSPAR grew and became ISRO in 1969, within DAE. 
                    In 1972, the government of India set up a Space Commission and DOS, bringing ISRO under it. The establishment of ISRO 
                    thus institutionalised space research activities in India. It since then has been managed by DOS, which governs 
                    various other institutions in India in the domain of astronomy and space technology. ISRO built India's first satellite, 
                    Aryabhata, which was launched by the Soviet Union in 1975. In 1980, ISRO launched satellite RS-1 onboard its own 
                    SLV-3, making India the sixth country to be capable of undertaking orbital launches. SLV-3 was followed by ASLV, 
                    which was subsequently succeeded by development of many medium-lift launch vehicles, rocket engines, satellite 
                    systems and networks enabling the agency to launch hundreds of domestic and foreign satellites and various deep 
                    space missions for space exploration. The agency's goals for the near future include expanding its satellite fleet, 
                    landing a rover on Moon, sending humans into space, development of a semi-cryogenic engine, sending more uncrewed 
                    missions to the Moon, Mars, Venus and the Sun, and deployment of more space telescopes in orbit to observe cosmic 
                    phenomena and space beyond the Solar System. Long-term plans include development of reusable launchers, heavy and 
                    super heavy launch vehicles, deploying a space station, sending exploration missions to the outer planets and 
                    asteroids and crewed missions to moons and planets.

                    The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) operates through a countrywide network of centres. Sensors and payloads 
                    are developed at the Space Applications Centre in Ahmedabad. Satellites are designed, developed, assembled, and 
                    tested at the U R Rao Satellite Centre (formerly the ISRO Satellite Centre) in Bangalore. Launch vehicles are 
                    developed at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre in Thiruvananthapuram. Launches take place at the Satish Dhawan Space 
                    Centre on Sriharikota Island, near Chennai. The Master Control Facilities for geostationary satellite station keeping 
                    are located at Hassan and Bhopal. Reception and processing facilities for remote-sensing data are at the National 
                    Remote Sensing Centre in Hyderabad. ISRO's commercial arm is Antrix Corporation, which has its headquarters in 
                    Bangalore.

                <h1>FOUNDATION</h1>
                <p>
                    Modern space research in India can be traced to the 1920s, when scientist S. K. Mitra conducted a series of 
                    experiments sounding of the ionosphere through ground-based radio in Kolkata. Later, Indian scientists like C.V. 
                    Raman and Meghnad Saha contributed to scientific principles applicable in space sciences. After 1945, important 
                    developments were made in coordinated space research in India by two scientists: Vikram Sarabhai—founder of the 
                    Physical Research Laboratory at Ahmedabad—and Homi Bhabha, who established the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research 
                    in 1945. Initial experiments in space sciences included the study of cosmic radiation, high altitude and airborne 
                    testing, deep underground experimentation at the Kolar mines—one of the deepest mining sites in the world—and studies 
                    of the upper atmosphere. These studies were done at research laboratories, universities, and independent locations. 
                    INCOSPAR was set up in 1962 by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on 
                    the urging of Vikram Sarabhai. There was no dedicated ministry for the space program initially and all activities of 
                    INCOSPAR relating to space technology continued to function within DAE. H.G.S. Murthy was appointed the first 
                    director of the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station, where sounding rockets were fired, marking the start of 
                    upper atmospheric research in India. An indigenous series of sounding rockets named Rohini was subsequently developed 
                    and started undergoing launches from 1967 onwards. From 1970s to 1980s, under the government of Indira Gandhi, INCOSPAR was superseded by ISRO. Later in 1972, a space 
                    commission and Department of Space (DOS) were set up to oversee space technology development in India specifically 
                    and ISRO was brought under DOS, institutionalising space research in India and forging the Indian space program into 
                    its existing form. India joined the Soviet Interkosmos program for space cooperation and got its first 
                    satellite Aryabhatta in orbit through a Soviet rocket. From 1990s to early 21st century, the arrival of PSLV in 1990s 
                    became a major boost for the Indian space program. With the exception of its first flight in 1994 and two partial 
                    failures later, PSLV had a streak of more than 50 successful flights. PSLV enabled India to launch all of its low 
                    Earth orbit satellites, small payloads to GTO and hundreds of foreign satellites. Along with the PSLV flights, 
                    development of a new rocket, a Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) was going on.

                                    The Indian National Satellite System (INSAT) is the country's telecommunication system. It is a 
                                    series of multipurpose geostationary satellites built and launched by ISRO to satisfy the 
                                    telecommunications, broadcasting, meteorology and search-and-rescue needs. Since the introduction of 
                                    the first one in 1983, INSAT has become the largest domestic communication system in the Asia-Pacific 
                                    Region. It is a joint venture of DOS, the Department of Telecommunications, India Meteorological 
                                    Department, All India Radio and Doordarshan. The overall coordination and management of INSAT system 
                                    rests with the Secretary-level INSAT Coordination Committee. The nomenclature of the series was 
                                    changed to "GSAT" from "INSAT", then further changed to "CMS" from 2020 onwards. These satellites 
                                    have been used by the Indian Armed Forces as well. GSAT-9 or "SAARC Satellite" provides communication 
                                    services for India's smaller neighbors.

                                    IRNSS with an operational name NavIC is an independent regional navigation satellite system developed 
                                    by India. It is designed to provide accurate position information service to users in India as well 
                                    as the region extending up to 1,500 km from its borders, which is its primary service area. 
                                    IRNSS provides two types of services, namely, Standard Positioning Service (SPS) and Restricted 
                                    Service (RS), providing a position accuracy of better than 20 m (66 ft) in the primary service area.
                                    It is an autonomous regional satellite navigation system developed by Indian Space Research 
                                    Organisation, which is under total control of Indian government. This navigation system is needed 
                                    because access to global navigation systems like GPS is not guaranteed in hostile situations.

                                    The initial launch in 1979 was a failure followed by a successful launch in 1980 making India the 
                                    sixth country in world with orbital launch capability. The development of bigger rockets began

                                    Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III (GSLV Mk III), also known as LVM3, is the heaviest 
                                    rocket in operational service with ISRO. Equipped with a more powerful cryogenic engine and boosters 
                                    than GSLV, it has significantly higher playload capacity and allows India to launch all its 
                                    communication satellites. LVM3 is expected to carry India's first crewed mission to space and 
                                    will be the testbed for SCE-200 engine which will power India's heavy lift rockets in future.
