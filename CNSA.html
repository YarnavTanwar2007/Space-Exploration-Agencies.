                <p>
                    China National Space administration is the government agency of the People's Republic of China that 
                    is responsible for civil space administration and international space cooperation, including organizing or leading 
                    foreign exchanges and cooperation in the aerospace field. An administrative agency under the Ministry of Industry 
                    and Information Technology, its headquarters are located in Haidian, Beijing. Founded in 1993, CNSA has pioneered a 
                    number of achievements in space for China despite its relatively short history, including becoming the first space 
                    agency to land on the far side of the Moon with Chang'e 4, bringing material back from the Moon with Chang'e 5, and 
                    being the second agency who successfully landed a rover on Mars with Tianwen-1. As the governing body of civil space 
                    activities, China National Space Administration does not execute any space program. The China Aerospace Science and 
                    Technology Corporation executes China's state space programs instead. The China Manned Space Program is operated 
                    by China Manned Space Agency, instead of the CNSA.

                <h1>FOUNDATION</h1>
                <p>
                    CNSA is an agency created in 1993 when the Ministry of Aerospace Industry was split into CNSA and the China Aerospace 
                    Science and Technology Corporation (CASC). The former was to be responsible for policy, while the latter was to be 
                    responsible for execution. This arrangement proved somewhat unsatisfactory, as these two agencies were, in effect, 
                    one large agency, sharing both personnel and management. As part of a massive restructuring in 1998, CASC was split 
                    into a number of smaller state-owned companies. The intention appeared to have been to create a system similar to 
                    that characteristic of Western defense procurement in which entities which are government agencies, setting 
                    operational policy, would then contract out their operational requirements to entities which were government-owned, 
                    but not government-managed. Since the passage of the Wolf Amendment in 2011, NASA has been forced by Congress to 
                    implement a long-standing exclusion policy with CNSA ever since, though this has been periodically overcome. CNSA was 
                    established as a government institution to develop and fulfill China's due international obligations, with the 
                    approval by the 8th National People's Congress of China (NPC). The 9th NPC assigned CNSA as an internal structure of 
                    the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (COSTIND). CNSA assumes the following main 
                    responsibilities: signing governmental agreements in the space area on behalf of organizations, inter-governmental 
                    scientific and technical exchanges; and also being in charge of the enforcement of national space policies and 
                    managing the national space science, technology and industry. China has signed governmental space cooperation 
                    agreements with Argentina, Brazil, Chile, France, Germany, India, Italy, Pakistan, Russia, Ukraine, the United 
                    Kingdom, the United States, and some other countries. Significant achievements have been scored in the bilateral and 
                    multilateral and technology exchanges and cooperation. China's space program evolved largely in secret under the 
                    joint control of the Chinese military and the Commission on Science, Technology, and Industry for the National 
                    Defense. After the communist takeover of 1949, the Chinese engineer Qian Xuesen, who had helped found the Jet 
                    Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., U.S., returned to China, where he became the guiding figure in the 
                    development of Chinese missiles and launch vehicles, both originally derived from a Soviet intercontinental ballistic 
                    missile. In 1956 Qian was named the first director of the Ministry of National Defense's Fifth Research Academy, 
                    which was founded to develop ballistic missiles and which later was in charge of the first steps in China's space 
                    program. In 1964 the space program was placed under the Seventh Ministry of Machine Building. The Seventh Ministry 
                    became the Ministry of Aerospace Industry in 1983. In 1993 the Ministry of Aerospace Industry was split into an 
                    independent Chinese Aerospace Corporation, which supervised most Chinese space-equipment manufacturers, and the CNSA.

                                    Shenzhou, any of a series of Chinese spacecraft, the fifth flight of which carried the first Chinese 
                                    astronaut into space. Shenzhou is similar in design to the Russian Soyuz spacecraft. Like Soyuz, 
                                    Shenzhou consists of three modules: a cylindrical rear module that contains instrumentation and the 
                                    propulsion system, a bell-shaped middle module that carries the crew during launch and landing, and a 
                                    cylindrical forward orbital module that carries scientific and military experiments. The first four 
                                    Shenzhou missions were uncrewed test flights launched over a three-year period (1999-2002). On 
                                    October 15, 2003, Shenzhou 5 carried the first Chinese astronaut, pilot Yang Liwei, on a 21-hour 
                                    spaceflight. China thus became the third country after Russia and the United States to launch a 
                                    crewed spacecraft. Shenzhou 6 was launched on October 12, 2005, lasted five days, and carried two 
                                    astronauts. Shenzhou 7 was launched on September 25, 2008, and carried three astronauts; one of them, 
                                    commander Zhai Zhigang, made the first Chinese space walk.

                                    Long March, Chinese Chang Zheng, family of Chinese launch vehicles. Like those of the United States 
                                    and Soviet Union, China's first launch vehicles were also based on ballistic missiles. The Long March 
                                    1 (LM-1, or Chang Zheng 1) vehicle, which put China's first satellite into orbit in 1970, was based 
                                    on the Dong Feng 3 intermediate-range ballistic missile, and the Long March 2 family of launch 
                                    vehicles, which has been used for roughly half of Chinese launches, was based on the Dong Feng 5 
                                    intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). There are several models of the LM-2 vehicle, with 
                                    different first stages and solid strap-ons; an LM-2F vehicle was used to launch the first Chinese 
                                    astronaut, Yang Liwei, into space in October 2003. There are also LM-3 and LM-4 launchers. The LM-3 
                                    is optimized for launches to geostationary orbit, and the LM-4, first launched in 1988, uses 
                                    hypergolic propellants rather than the conventional kerosene-liquid oxygen combination used in 
                                    previous Long March variants.China has developed a second-generation family of launchers, identified 
                                    as LM-5, LM-6, and LM-7, that are not based on an ICBM design. All three had their first flight in 
                                    2016. The LM-5 can launch payloads to geostationary orbit that are more than five times heavier than 
                                    those carried by the LM-4. The LM-6 is designed to launch small payloads of about 1,000 kg to low 
                                    Earth orbit. The LM-7 launched slightly smaller payloads than those carried by the LM-5. Aside from 
                                    this second-generation family, China has also built a small solid-fuel rocket, the LM-11, which can 
                                    be launched from either a floating barge or a mobile launcher and which had its first flight in 2015.

                                    Chang'e, series of lunar probes launched by the China National Space Administration. The satellites 
                                    are named for a goddess who, according to Chinese legend, flew from Earth to the Moon. Chang'e 1 was 
                                    China's first spacecraft to travel beyond Earth orbit. Its mission included stereoscopic imaging of 
                                    the lunar surface, assaying the chemistry of the surface, and testing technologies that could be used 
                                    in expanding the Chinese national space program to the Moon. A Long March 3A rocket launched Chang'e 1 
                                    into an elliptical Earth orbit on October 24, 2007. An upper stage injected it toward the Moon, and 
                                    it entered lunar orbit on November 5, 2007. Two days later it settled into a 200-km (120-mile) near 
                                    polar orbit. After nearly 16 months in lunar orbit, Chang'e 1 was crashed into the Moon on March 1, 
                                    2009. Chang'e 1 carried eight instruments. A stereo camera and a laser altimeter developed a 
                                    three-dimensional map of the surface with the camera tilting forward, down, and aft to illuminate 
                                    three charge-coupled device (CCD) arrays. The interferometer spectrometer imager used a special lens 
                                    system to project light onto an array of CCDs. X-ray and gamma-ray spectrometers measured radiation 
                                    emitted by naturally decaying heavy elements or produced in response to solar radiation. These 
                                    spectral data helped quantify the amounts of minerals on the lunar surface. The microwave radiometer 
                                    detected microwaves emitted by the Moon itself and thus measured the thickness of the debris layer, 
                                    or regolith, that fills the huge basins called maria. One aim of the regolith investigations was to 
                                    understand how much helium-3 may be on the Moon. Helium-3 is a trace element in the solar wind, and 
                                    the lunar surface has absorbed larger quantities of helium-3 than have been found on Earth. If mining 
                                    on the Moon ever becomes practical, helium-3 would be a valuable fuel for nuclear fusion power. Other 
                                    instruments monitored the solar wind and the space environment.
