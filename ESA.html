                <p>European Space Agency (ESA), French Agence Spatiale Européenne (ASE), European space and space-technology research 
                    organization founded in 1975 from the merger of the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) and the European 
                    Space Research Organisation (ESRO), both established in 1964. Members include Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, 
                    Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, 
                    Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Slovenia is an associate member. 
                    Cooperative agreements have been signed by various countries, including Canada (1981), which participate in some ESA 
                    projects. Headquarters of the agency are in Paris. Representatives of ESA's member nations form the agency's 
                    policy-making council. A science program committee established by convention deals with matters related to the 
                    mandatory science program; other such bodies may be formed by the council to assist in decision making. The chief 
                    executive and legal representative of ESA is the director general, assisted by an inspector general and the directors 
                    of various departments. ESA has a worldwide staff of about 2,200 in 2018 and an annual budget of about €7.2 billion 
                    in 2022. ESA's space flight programme includes human spaceflight mainly through participation in the International 
                    Space Station program, the launch and operation of unmanned exploration missions to other planets and the Moon,
                    Earth observation, science and telecommunication, designing launch vehicles, and maintaining a major spaceport, the 
                    Guiana Space Centre at Kourou, French Guiana. The main European launch vehicle Ariane 5 is operated through 
                    Arianespace with ESA sharing in the costs of launching and further developing this launch vehicle. The agency is also 
                    working with NASA to manufacture the Orion spacecraft service module that will fly on the Space Launch System.

                <h1>FOUNDATION</h1>
                <p>
                    After World War II, many European scientists left Western Europe in order to work with the United States. Although 
                    the 1950s boom made it possible for Western European countries to invest in research and specifically in 
                    space-related activities, Western European scientists realised solely national projects would not be able to compete 
                    with the two main superpowers. In 1958, only months after the Sputnik shock, Edoardo Amaldi from Italy and Pierre Auger 
                    from France, two prominent members of the Western European scientific community, met to discuss the foundation of a 
                    common Western European space agency. The meeting was attended by scientific representatives from eight countries. The 
                    Western European nations decided to have two agencies: one concerned with developing a launch system, ELDO, and the 
                    other the precursor of the European Space Agency, ESRO. The latter was established on 20 March 1964 by an agreement 
                    signed on 14 June 1962. From 1968 to 1972, ESRO launched seven research satellites, but ELDO was not able to deliver
                    a launch vehicle. Both agencies struggled with underfunding and diverging interests of its participants. ESA in its 
                    current form was founded with the ESA Convention in 1975, when ESRO was merged with ELDO. ESA launched its first 
                    major scientific mission in 1975, Cos-B, a space probe monitoring gamma-ray emissions in the universe, which was 
                    first worked on by ESRO.

                                    The FAST 20XX program run from 2009 to 2012 and was intended to provide a technological foundation 
                                    for the industrial introduction of advanced hypersonic suborbital spaceplanes in the medium to longer 
                                    term. No detailed vehicle design was planned under the program, with work instead focusing on 
                                    mastering the technologies required for the development of such designs. Once the needed technologies 
                                    were identified, researchers developed the dedicated analytical, numerical and experimental tools 
                                    needed to investigate them. The project also looked at the legal and regulatory issues related to 
                                    suborbital flight in consultation with government and international authorities. Two concepts have 
                                    been focused on under the program. The first, ALPHA, is based on SpaceShipOne, which won the Ansari 
                                    X-Prize in 2003. A key aspect of the design is the need for a carrier plane to launch the suborbital 
                                    vessel. The second design to be analyzed is based on the German Aerospace Center's SpaceLiner concept.
                                    The SpaceLiner is an all-rocket-propelled vehicle intended to achieve a step change in ultra-fast 
                                    long-haul passenger and freight transport, with the intended ability to transport 50 passengers from 
                                    Australia to Europe in 90 minutes.

                                    Galileo is a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) that went live in 2016, created by the 
                                    European Union through the ESA, operated by the European Union Agency for 
                                    the Space Programme (EUSPA), headquartered in Prague, Czech Republic, with two ground operations 
                                    centres in Fucino, Italy, and Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. The €10 billion project is named after 
                                    the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei. One of the aims of Galileo is to provide an independent 
                                    high-precision positioning system so European political and military authorities do not have to rely 
                                    on the US GPS, or the Russian GLONASS systems, which could be disabled or degraded by their operators 
                                    at any time. The use of basic (lower-precision) Galileo services is free and open to everyone. 
                                    A fully encrypted higher-precision service is available for free to government-authorized users. 
                                    Galileo is intended to provide horizontal and vertical position measurements within 1-metre 
                                    (3 ft 3 in) precision, and better positioning services at higher latitudes than other positioning 
                                    systems. Galileo is also to provide a new global search and rescue (SAR) function as part of the 
                                    MEOSAR system.

                                    In November and December 1983, ESA made the first open call for mission proposals to the European 
                                    scientific community, based on an idea for a community-driven programme presented by Bonnet to the 
                                    SPC in late 1983. The call yielded 68 proposals - 30 in the field of astronomy and 34 in the field 
                                    of solar physics, with 4 miscellaneous concepts also submitted. An ad hoc "survey committee" led by 
                                    then-SRON Director Johan Bleeker was convened, consisting members of the SSAC, CERN, the European

                                    delivers two communications satellites of up to 10 tonnes into GTO. It failed during its first test 
                                    flight in 2002, but has since made 82 consecutive successful flights until a partial failure in January 
                                    2018. The other version, Ariane 5 ES, was used to launch the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) to the 
                                    International Space Station (ISS) and will be used to launch four Galileo navigational satellites at a 
                                    time.In November 2012, ESA agreed to build an upgraded variant called Ariane 5 ME (Mid-life Evolution) 
                                    which would increase payload capacity to 11.5 tonnes to GTO and feature a restartable second stage to 
                                    allow more complex missions. Ariane 5 ME was scheduled to fly in 2018, but the project was abandoned in 
                                    favor of Ariane 6, which is planned to replace Ariane 5 in the 2020s.

                                    Soyuz-2 also called the Soyuz-ST or Soyuz-STK, is a Russian medium payload launcher which was brought 
                                    into ESA service in October 2011. ESA entered into a €340 
                                    million joint venture with the Russian Federal Space Agency over the use of the Soyuz launcher. 
                                    Under the agreement, the Russian agency manufactured Soyuz rocket parts for ESA, which were then 
                                    shipped to French Guiana for assembly. ESA benefited because it gains a medium payload launcher, 
                                    complementing its fleet while saving on development costs. The Soyuz rocket—which has been the 
                                    Russian's space launch workhorse for more than 50 years was proven technology with a very good 
                                    safety record. Russia benefited in that it gets access to the Kourou launch site. Due to its 
                                    proximity to the equator, launching from Kourou rather than Baikonur nearly doubled Soyuz's payload 
                                    to GTO.

                                    Vega is ESA's carrier for small satellites. Developed by seven ESA members led by Italy, it is 
                                    capable of carrying a payload with a mass of between 300 and 1500 kg to an altitude of 700 km, for 
                                    low polar orbit. Its maiden launch from Kourou was on 13 February 2012. Vega began full commercial 
                                    exploitation in December 2015. The rocket has three solid propulsion stages and a liquid propulsion 
                                    upper stage (the AVUM) for accurate orbital insertion and the ability to place multiple payloads into 
                                    different orbits. A larger version of the Vega launcher, Vega-C is in development and the first 
                                    flight is expected in June 2021.
