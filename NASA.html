                <p>
                    NASA was established in 1958, succeeding the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), to give the US space 
                    development effort a distinctly civilian orientation, emphasizing peaceful applications in space science. 
                    Since its establishment, most American space exploration efforts have been led by NASA, including the Apollo Moon 
                    landing missions, the Skylab space station, and later the Space Shuttle. NASA is supporting the International Space 
                    Station and is overseeing the development of the Orion spacecraft, the Space Launch System, Commercial Crew vehicles, 
                    and the planned Lunar Gateway space station. The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program, which 
                    provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for uncrewed NASA launches. NASA's science is 
                    focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System, advancing heliophysics through the 
                    efforts of the Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research Program, exploring bodies throughout the Solar 
                    System with advanced robotic spacecraft such as New Horizons, and researching astrophysics topics, such as the Big 
                    Bang, through the Great Observatories and associated programs. The organization is composed of four mission 
                    directorates - Aeronautics Research, for the development of advanced aviation technologies; Science, dealing with 
                    programs for understanding the origin, structure, and evolution of the universe, the solar system, and Earth; Space 
                    Technology, for the development of space science and exploration technologies; and Human Exploration and Operations, 
                    concerning the management of crewed space missions, including those to the International Space Station, as well as 
                    operations related to launch services, space transportation, and space communications for both crewed and robotic 
                    exploration programs. A number of additional research centres are affiliated, including the Goddard Space Flight 
                    Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California; the Johnson Space Center in 
                    Houston, Texas; and the Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. NASA was created largely in response to the 
                    Soviet launching of Sputnik in 1957. It was organized around the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), 
                    which had been created by Congress in 1915. NASA's organization was well under way by the early years of Pres. John 
                    F. Kennedy's administration when he proposed that the United States put a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s. 
                    To that end, the Apollo program was designed, and in 1969 the U.S. astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first person 
                    on the Moon. Later, uncrewed programs—such as Viking, Mariner, Voyager, and Galileo—explored other bodies of the 
                    solar system.

                <h1>FOUNDATION</h1>
                <p>
                    Beginning in 1946, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) began experimenting with rocket planes such 
                    as the supersonic Bell X-1.[14] In the early 1950s, there was challenge to launch an artificial satellite for the 
                    International Geophysical Year (1957-1958). An effort for this was the American Project Vanguard. After the Soviet 
                    space program's launch of the world's first artificial satellite (Sputnik 1) on October 4, 1957, the attention of the 
                    United States turned toward its own fledgling space efforts. The U.S. Congress, alarmed by the perceived threat to 
                    national security and technological leadership (known as the "Sputnik crisis"), urged immediate and swift action; 
                    President Dwight D. Eisenhower counseled more deliberate measures. The result was a consensus that the White House 
                    forged among key interest groups, including scientists committed to basic research; the Pentagon which had to match 
                    the Soviet military achievement; corporate America looking for new business; and a strong new trend in public opinion 
                    looking up to space exploration. On July 29, 1958, Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act, 
                    establishing NASA. When it began operations on October 1, 1958, NASA absorbed the 43-year-old NACA intact; its 
                    8,000 employees, an annual budget of US $100 million, three major research laboratories (Langley Aeronautical 
                    Laboratory, Ames Aeronautical Laboratory, and Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory) and two small test facilities.
                    Elements of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency and the United States Naval Research Laboratory were incorporated into 
                    NASA. A significant contributor to NASA's entry into the Space Race with the Soviet Union was the technology from the 
                    German rocket program led by Wernher von Braun, who was now working for the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA), 
                    which in turn incorporated the technology of American scientist Robert Goddard's earlier works. Earlier research 
                    efforts within the US Air Force and many of ARPA's early space programs were also transferred to NASA. In 
                    December 1958, NASA gained control of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a contractor facility operated by the California 
                    Institute of Technology.

                                    NASA inherited NACA's X-15 experimental rocket-powered hypersonic research aircraft, developed in 
                                    conjunction with the US Air Force and Navy. Three planes were built starting in 1955. The X-15 was 
                                    drop-launched from the wing of one of two NASA Boeing B-52 Stratofortresses, NB52A tail number 52-003, 
                                    and NB52B, tail number 52-008 (known as the Balls 8). Release took place at an altitude of about 45,000 
                                    feet and a speed of about 805 km/h. Twelve pilots were selected for the program from the Air Force, 
                                    Navy, and NACA. A total of 199 flights were made between June 1959 and December 1968, resulting in the 
                                    official world record for the highest speed ever reached by a crewed powered aircraft (current as of 
                                    2014), and a maximum speed of Mach 6.72, 4,519 miles per hour (7,273 km/h).[52] The altitude record for 
                                    X-15 was 354,200 feet (107.96 km).

                                    In 1958, NASA formed an engineering group, the Space Task Group, to manage their human spaceflight 
                                    programs under the direction of Robert Gilruth. Their earliest programs were conducted under the 
                                    pressure of the Cold War competition between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. NASA inherited the US Air 
                                    Force's Man in Space Soonest program, which considered many crewed spacecraft designs ranging from 
                                    rocket planes like the X-15, to small ballistic space capsules. By 1958, the space plane concepts 
                                    were eliminated in favor of the ballistic capsule, and NASA renamed it Project Mercury. The first 
                                    seven astronauts were selected among candidates from the Navy, Air Force and Marine test pilot 
                                    programs. On May 5, 1961, astronaut Alan Shepard became the first American in space aboard a capsule 
                                    he named Freedom 7, launched on a Redstone booster on a 15-minute ballistic flight.

                                <p>
                                    Based on studies to grow the Mercury spacecraft capabilities to long-duration flights, developing 
                                    space rendezvous techniques, and precision Earth landing, Project Gemini was started as a two-man 
                                    program in 1961 to overcome the Soviets' lead and to support the Apollo crewed lunar landing program, 
                                    adding extravehicular activity (EVA) and rendezvous and docking to its objectives. The first crewed 
                                    Gemini flight, Gemini 3, was flown by Gus Grissom and John Young on March 23, 1965. Nine missions 
                                    followed in 1965 and 1966, demonstrating an endurance mission of nearly fourteen days, rendezvous, 
                                    docking, and practical EVA, and gathering medical data on the effects of weightlessness on humans.

                                    The U.S public's perception of the Soviet lead in the Space Race (by putting the first man into space) 
                                    motivated President John F. Kennedy to ask the Congress on May 25, 1961, to commit the federal 
                                    government to a program to land a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s, which effectively launched 
                                    the Apollo program. Apollo was one of the most expensive American scientific programs ever. It cost 
                                    more than $20 billion in 1960s dollars or an estimated $236 billion in present-day US dollars. 
                                    (In comparison, the Manhattan Project cost roughly $30.1 billion, accounting for inflation). 
                                    It used the Saturn rockets as launch vehicles, which were far bigger than the rockets built for 
                                    previous projects. The spacecraft was also bigger; it had two main parts, the combined command 
                                    and service module (CSM) and the Apollo Lunar Module (LM). The LM was to be left on the Moon and only 
                                    the command module (CM) containing the three astronauts would return to Earth. The planned first crew 
                                    of 3 astronauts were killed due to a fire during a 1967 preflight test for the Apollo 204 mission 
                                    . The second crewed mission, Apollo 8, brought astronauts for the first time in a flight around the 
                                    Moon in December 1968.[74] Shortly before, the Soviets had sent an uncrewed spacecraft around the Moon.
                                    On the next two missions docking maneuvers that were needed for the Moon landing were practiced and 
                                    then finally the Moon landing was made on the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969. The first person to 
                                    walk on the Moon was Neil Armstrong, who was followed 19 minutes later by Buzz Aldrin, while Michael 
                                    Collins orbited above. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon, the last 
                                    in December 1972. Throughout these six Apollo spaceflights, twelve men walked on the Moon. These 
                                    missions returned a wealth of scientific data and 381.7 kilograms of lunar samples. Topics covered by 
                                    experiments performed included soil mechanics, meteoroids, seismology, heat flow, lunar ranging, 
                                    magnetic fields, and solar wind. The Moon landing marked the end of the space race, 
                                    and as a gesture, Armstrong mentioned mankind when he stepped down on the Moon.

                                <p>
                                    Skylab was the United States' first and only independently built space station. Conceived in 1965 as 
                                    a workshop to be constructed in space from a spent Saturn IB upper stage, the 77088 kg station was 
                                    constructed on Earth and launched on May 14, 1973, atop the first two stages of a Saturn V, into a 
                                    435 kms orbit inclined at 50° to the equator. Damaged during launch by the loss of 
                                    its thermal protection and one electricity-generating solar panel, it was repaired to functionality 
                                    by its first crew. It was occupied for a total of 171 days by 3 successive crews in 1973 and 1974. 
                                    It included a laboratory for studying the effects of microgravity, and a solar observatory. NASA 
                                    planned to have a Space Shuttle dock with it, and elevate Skylab to a higher safe altitude, but the 
                                    Shuttle was not ready for flight before Skylab's re-entry on July 11, 1979.

                                <p>
                                    On May 24, 1972, US President Richard M. Nixon and Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin signed an agreement 
                                    calling for a joint crewed space mission, and declaring intent for all future international crewed 
                                    spacecraft to be capable of docking with each other. This authorized the Apollo-Soyuz Test 
                                    Project (ASTP), involving the rendezvous and docking in Earth orbit of a surplus Apollo command and 
                                    service module with a Soyuz spacecraft. The mission took place in July 1975. This was the last US 
                                    human spaceflight until the first orbital flight of the Space Shuttle in April 1981.

                                    The Space Shuttle became the major focus of NASA in the late 1970s and the 1980s. Originally planned 
                                    as a frequently launchable, fully reusable vehicle, the design was changed to use an expendable 
                                    external propellant tank to reduce development cost, and four Space Shuttle orbiters were built by 
                                    1985. The first to launch, Columbia, did so on April 12, 1981, the 20th anniversary of the first 
                                    human spaceflight. The Shuttle flew 135 missions and carried 355 astronauts from 16 countries, many 
                                    on multiple trips. Its major components were a spaceplane orbiter with an external fuel tank and two 
                                    solid-fuel launch rockets at its side. The external tank, which was bigger than the spacecraft itself, 
                                    was the only major component that was not reused. The shuttle could orbit in altitudes of 185-643 km 
                                    and carry a maximum payload of 24,400 kg. Missions could last from 5 to 17 days and crews could be 
                                    from 2 to 8 astronauts. On 20 missions (1983-1998) the Space Shuttle carried Spacelab, designed in 
                                    cooperation with the European Space Agency. Spacelab was not designed for independent orbital 
                                    flight, but remained in the Shuttle's cargo bay as the astronauts entered and left it through an 
                                    airlock. On June 18, 1983, Sally Ride became the first American woman in space, on board the Space 
                                    Shuttle Challenger STS-7 mission. Another famous series of missions were the launch and later 
                                    successful repair of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and 1993, respectively.

                                    The International Space Station (ISS) combines NASA's Space Station Freedom project with the 
                                    Soviet/Russian Mir-2 station, the European Columbus station, and the Japanese laboratory module.
                                    NASA originally planned in the 1980s to develop Freedom alone, but US budget constraints led to the 
                                    merger of these projects into a single multi-national program in 1993, managed by NASA, the Russian 
                                    Federal Space Agency (RKA), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the European Space Agency 
                                    (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The station consists of pressurized modules, 
                                    external trusses, solar arrays and other components, which were manufactured in various factories 
                                    around the world, and have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and the US Space 
                                    Shuttles. The on-orbit assembly began in 1998, the completion of the US Orbital Segment occurred in 
                                    2009 and the completion of the Russian Orbital Segment occurred in 2010, though there are some 
                                    debates of whether new modules should be added in the segment. The ownership and use of the space 
                                    station is established in intergovernmental treaties and agreements which divide the station 
                                    into two areas and allow Russia to retain full ownership of the Russian Orbital Segment (with the 
                                    exception of Zarya), with the US Orbital Segment allocated between the other international partners.

                                    While the Space Shuttle program was still suspended after the loss of Columbia, President George W. 
                                    Bush announced the Vision for Space Exploration including the retirement of the Space Shuttle after 
                                    completing the International Space Station. The plan was enacted into law by the NASA Authorization 
                                    Act of 2005 and directs NASA to develop and launch the Crew Exploration Vehicle (later called Orion) 
                                    by 2010, return Americans to the Moon by 2020, land on Mars as feasible, repair the Hubble Space 
                                    Telescope, and continue scientific investigation through robotic solar system exploration, human 
                                    presence on the ISS, Earth observation, and astrophysics research. The crewed exploration goals
                                    prompted NASA's Constellation program.

                                    The Commercial Crew Program (CCP) provides commercially-operated crew transportation service to and 
                                    from the International Space Station (ISS) under contract to NASA, conducting crew rotations between 
                                    the expeditions of the International Space Station program. American space manufacturer SpaceX began 
                                    providing service in 2020, using the Crew Dragon spacecraft, and NASA plans to add Boeing when its 
                                    Boeing Starliner spacecraft becomes operational some time after 2022. A Crew Dragon spacecraft is 
                                    launched to space atop a Falcon 9 Block 5 launch vehicle and the capsule returns to Earth via 
                                    splashdown in the ocean near Florida. The program's first operational mission, SpaceX Crew-1, 
                                    launched on 16 November 2020. Boeing Starliner spacecraft will participate after its final test 
                                    flight, launched atop an Atlas V N22 or Vulcan Centaur launch vehicle. Instead of a splashdown, a 
                                    Starliner capsule will return on land with airbags at one of four designated sites in the western 
                                    United States. Development of the Commercial Crew Program began in 2011 as NASA shifted from internal 
                                    development of crewed vehicles to perform ISS crew rotation to commercial industry development of 
                                    transport to the ISS. A series of open competitions over the following two years saw successful bids 
                                    from Boeing, Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada, and SpaceX to develop proposals for ISS crew transport 
                                    vehicles.

                                    President Obama's plan was to develop American private spaceflight capabilities to get astronauts to 
                                    the International Space Station, replace Russian Soyuz capsules, and use Orion capsules for ISS 
                                    emergency escape purposes. During a speech at the Kennedy Space Center on April 15, 2010, Obama 
                                    proposed a new heavy-lift vehicle (HLV) to replace the formerly planned Ares V. In his speech, Obama 
                                    called for a crewed mission to an asteroid as soon as 2025, and a crewed mission to Mars orbit by the 
                                    mid-2030s. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 was passed by Congress and signed into law on October 
                                    11, 2010. The act officially canceled the Constellation program. NASA undertook a feasibility study 
                                    in 2012 and developed the Asteroid Redirect Mission as an uncrewed mission to move a boulder-sized 
                                    near-Earth asteroid (or boulder-sized chunk of a larger asteroid) into lunar orbit. The mission would 
                                    demonstrate ion thruster technology, and develop techniques that could be used for planetary defense 
                                    against an asteroid collision, as well as a cargo transport to Mars in support of a future human 
                                    mission. The Moon-orbiting boulder might then later be visited by astronauts. The Asteroid Redirect 
                                    Mission was cancelled in 2017 as part of the FY2018 NASA budget.

                                <p>
                                    Since 2017, NASA's crewed spaceflight program has been the Artemis program, which involves the help 
                                    of U.S. commercial spaceflight companies and international partners such as ESA, JAXA, and CSA. The 
                                    goal of this program is to land "the first woman and the next man" on the lunar south pole region by 
                                    2024. Artemis would be the first step towards the long-term goal of establishing a sustainable 
                                    presence on the Moon, laying the foundation for companies to build a lunar economy, and eventually 
                                    sending humans to Mars. The Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle was held over from the canceled 
                                    Constellation program for Artemis. Artemis 1 is the uncrewed initial launch of Space Launch System 
                                    (SLS) that would also send an Orion spacecraft on a Distant Retrograde Orbit. NASA's next major space 
                                    initiative is to be the construction of the Lunar Gateway. This initiative is to involve the 
                                    construction of a new space station, which will have many features in common with the current 
                                    International Space Station, except that it will be in orbit about the Moon, instead of the Earth. 
                                    This space station will be designed primarily for non-continuous human habitation. The first 
                                    tentative steps of returning to crewed lunar missions will be Artemis 2, which is to include the 
                                    Orion crew module, propelled by the SLS, and is to launch in 2024.

                                    The Commercial Low Earth Orbit Destinations program is an initiative by NASA to support work on 
                                    commercial space stations that the agency hopes to have in place by the end of the current decade to 
                                    replace the "International Space Station". The three selected companies are: Blue Origin 
                                    with their Orbital Reef station concept, Nanoracks with their Starlab Space Station concept, 
                                    and Northrop Grumman with an unnamed station concept based on the HALO-module for the Gateway station.
