                <p>
                    The State Space Corporation, commonly known simply as Roscosmos , is a state 
                    corporation of the Russian Federation responsible for space flights, cosmonautics programs, and aerospace research. 
                    Originating from the Soviet space program founded in the 1950s, Roscosmos emerged following the dissolution of the 
                    Soviet Union in 1991. It initially began as the Russian Space Agency, which was established on 25 February 1992 and 
                    restructured in 1999 and 2004, as the Russian Aviation and Space Agency and the Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos), 
                    respectively. In 2015, the Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos) was merged with the United Rocket and Space Corporation, 
                    a government corporation, to re-nationalize the Russian space industry, leading to Roscosmos in its current form. 
                    Roscosmos is headquartered in Moscow, with its main Mission Control Center in the nearby city of Korolyov, and the 
                    Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center located in Star City in Moscow Oblast. Its launch facilities include Baikonur 
                    Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, the world's first and largest spaceport, and Vostochny Cosmodrome, which is being built in 
                    the Russian Far East in Amur Oblast. Its director since May 2018 is Dmitry Rogozin. As the main successor to the 
                    Soviet space program, Roscosmos' legacy includes the world's first satellite, first human spaceflight, and first 
                    space station (Salyut). Its current activities include the International Space Station, wherein it is a major partner.
                    On 22 February 2019, Roscosmos announced the construction of its new headquarters in Moscow, the National Space 
                    Centre. Its Astronaut Corps is the first in the world's history.

                <h1>FOUNDATION</h1>
                <p>
                    The Soviet space program did not have central executive agencies. Instead, its organizational architecture was 
                    multi-centered; it was the design bureaus and the council of designers that had the most say, not the political 
                    leadership. The creation of a central agency after the separation of Russia from the Soviet Union was therefore a new 
                    development. The Russian Space Agency was formed on 25 February 1992, by a decree of President Yeltsin. Yuri Koptev, 
                    who had previously worked with designing Mars landers at NPO Lavochkin, became the agency's first director. In the 
                    early years, the agency suffered from lack of authority as the powerful design bureaus fought to protect their own 
                    spheres of operation and to survive. For example, the decision to keep Mir in operation beyond 1999 was not made by 
                    the agency, but by the private shareholder board of the Energia design bureau. Another example is that the decision 
                    to develop the new Angara rocket was rather a function of Khrunichev's ability to attract resources than a conscious 
                    long-term decision by the agency. The 1990s saw serious financial problems due to the decreased cash flow, which 
                    encouraged the space agency to improvise and seek other ways to keep space programs running. This resulted in the 
                    agency's leading role in commercial satellite launches and space tourism. Scientific missions, such 
                    as interplanetary probes or astronomy missions during these years played a very small role, and although the agency 
                    had connections with the Russian aerospace forces, its budget was not part of Russia's defense budget; nevertheless, 
                    the agency managed to operate the Mir space station well past its planned lifespan, contributed to the International 
                    Space Station, and continued to fly Soyuz and Progress missions. On 31 October 2000, a Soyuz spacecraft lifted off 
                    from the Baikonur Cosmodrome at 10:53 a.m. Kazakhstan time. On board were Expedition One Commander William M. Shepherd 
                    of NASA and cosmonauts Sergei Krikalev and Yuri Gidzenko of Roscosmos. The trio arrived at the International Space 
                    Station on 2 November, marking the start of an uninterrupted human presence on the orbiting laboratory.

                                    NASA's Unity Module. The Rassvet module was launched aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis and is 
                                    primarily used for cargo storage and as a docking port for visiting spacecraft. The Nauka module is

                                    date in 2007, but attached to ISS in July 2021. Roscosmos is furthermore responsible for 
                                    expedition crew launches by Soyuz-TMA spacecraft and resupplies the space station with Progress space 
                                    transporters. After the initial ISS contract with NASA expired, Roscosmos and NASA, with the approval 
                                    of the US government, entered into a space contract running until 2011, according to which Roscosmos 
                                    will sell NASA spots on Soyuz spacecraft for approximately $21 million per person each way 
                                    as well as provide Progress transport flights.

                                    On 19 July 2014, Roscosmos launched the Foton-M4 satellite containing, among other animals and 
                                    plants, a group of five geckos.[44][45] The five geckos, four females and one male, were used as a 
                                    part of the Gecko-F4 research program aimed at measuring the effects of weightlessness on the lizards' 
                                    ability to procreate and develop in the harsh environment. However, soon after the spacecraft exited 
                                    the atmosphere, mission control lost contact with the vessel which led to an attempt to reestablish 
                                    communication that was only achieved later in the mission. When the satellite returned to Earth after 
                                    its planned two-month mission had been cut short to 44 days, the space agency researchers reported 
                                    that all the geckos had perished during the flight.

                                    Soyuz-2 (GRAU index 14A14) is a modernized version of the Soviet Soyuz rocket. In its basic form, it 
                                    is a three-stage launch vehicle for placing payloads into low Earth orbit. Compared to the previous 
                                    versions of the Soyuz, the first-stage boosters and two core stages feature uprated engines with 
                                    improved injection systems. Digital flight control and telemetry systems allow the rocket to be 
                                    launched from a fixed launch platform, whereas the launch platforms for earlier Soyuz rockets had to 
                                    be rotated as the rocket could not perform a roll to change its heading in flight. Soyuz-2 is often 
                                    flown with an upper stage, which allows it to lift payloads into higher orbits, such as Molniya and 
                                    geosynchronous orbits. The upper stage is equipped with independent flight control and telemetry 
                                    systems from those used in the rest of the rocket. The NPO Lavochkin manufactured Fregat is the most 
                                    commonly used upper stage. Soyuz-2 rockets were first launched from Site 31 at the Baikonur 
                                    Cosmodrome, and Site 43 at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, launch facilities shared with earlier R-7 derived 
                                    rockets including the Soyuz-U and Molniya. Commercial Soyuz-2 flights are contracted by Starsem and 
                                    have launched from Site 31 at Baikonur Cosmodrome and ELS (Ensemble de Lancement Soyouz), which has 
                                    been built at the Centre Spatial Guyanais on the northern coast of South America. The Soyuz-2 version 
                                    ST-B can deliver 3,250 kg to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) from this equatorial site. 
                                    In 2016, the new Vostochny Cosmodrome started operating Soyuz-2 flights as well, from its first launch 
                                    pad called Vostochny Cosmodrome Site 1S. It has its many variants.

                                    and is a partially-reusable, methane-fueled, orbital launch vehicle currently in the design concept 
                                    stage of development by the Roscosmos State Corporation in Russia. Design began by 2020, with 
                                    operational flights planned for no earlier than 2026. Amur is intended to substitute for the existing 
                                    Soyuz-2, at a much lower per launch cost. This is a proposed family of new Russian rockets proposed 
                                    by JSC SRC Progress in the mid-2010s, to replace the legacy Soyuz for launch after the early 2020s. 
                                    JSC SRC Progress had been the manufacturer and custodian of the Soyuz family design for many decades.

                                    Irtysh, also named Soyuz-5, formerly codenamed Fenix in Russian and Sunkar in Kazakh, is a planned 
                                    Russian rocket that is being developed by JSC SRC Progress within the "Project Feniks". Initially it 
                                    will replace the capability of Zenit-2 and Proton Medium, and in the future will serve as the base of 
                                    a super heavy-lift launch vehicle rocket (Yenisei) to match the Energia/Buran capabilities. As of 
                                    February 2021, Irtysh is expected to launch from the Baikonur Baiterek, the ex Zenit-2 launch site, in 
                                    a partnership with the government of Kazakhstan, with a planned debut in late 2023.

                                    Yenisei , project name RN STK-1 , was the first super-heavy launch vehicle being developed by the 
                                    Russian space industry since the fall of the USSR. The main developer is RSC Energia. It is being 
                                    developed within the framework of the federal target program "Creation of a super-heavy class space 
                                    rocket complex for 2020-2030" and the program cost is estimated at 1.5 trillion roubles 
                                    (US$1.6 billion). It is the main rocket of the Russian Lunar program. The final design for the rocket 
                                    was expected to be complete by autumn 2021, but the program appears to have been paused or stopped 
                                    just before this expected completion date.
